Each group is led by a kkwaenggwari (small handheld gong) player, and includes at least one person playing janggu (hourglass drum), buk (barrel drum), and jing (gong). Wind instruments (t'aepyongso and nabal) are sometimes played along with the drummers. Following the drummers are dancers, who often play the sogo (a small drum that makes almost no sound) and tend to have more elaborate choreography. Finally, japsaek (actors) dressed as caricatures of traditional village roles wander around to engage spectators, blurring the boundary between performers and audience. Minyo (Korean traditional chants) are performed in Pungmul sometimes, and audience members enthusiastically sing and dance along. Most Minyo are set to drum beats in one of a few jangdan (rhythmic patterns) that are common to Pungmul, Sanjo, P'ansori, and other traditional Korean musical genres.\", 'title': 'Pungmul', 'wiki_id': '20231101.simple_186757_1', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pungmul'}\n",

When the major makes love to Marie we hear this leitmotif.  The music makes us realize that he is not forcing her to love him but that she is willing.  In another place, the military music tells us that Marie is thinking of the Drum major.', 'title': 'Wozzeck', 'wiki_id': '20231101.simple_82005_22', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wozzeck'}\n"
